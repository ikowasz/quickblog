# So, how to tags?
> #quickblog #weeknightchanges
### I kinda solved it
Yeah, I was thinking since yesterday: "how can I make it OK with standard markdown and also parsable?"\
I got it

##### A quote just right after first header.
It looks OK enough in pure MD, and is easily selectable.


### Other options?
I thought about making it just an anchor. While it is understandable that a hashtag should link to something like an
aggregate page, it would be probably not as readable as just a list of hashtags in a quote. It marks the text without
any additional requirements.

### Is it not too serious?
Well, maybe? Why am I ever asking this questions? Let we just see, gotdamit!

### And some code?
Tomorrow, or thursday.\
I can see something like: seeing some hashtag, add it to the list and link to the final page.\
Then: Generate a page from the links. \
Well, right now I can see a problem: there isn't any post page, so it might be needed first. Two features in the closest
todo, yay! \
Forget the deadline, time will show.
