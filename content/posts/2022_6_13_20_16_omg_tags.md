### I clearly forgot something
Well, while I really wanted to have my blog ASAP, just for having any place to create content, I feel urge to separate a
few things.

Mainly, I'm going to write about IT, but sometimes it will be anything of my other interests.

I don't want to make some overgrown markdown to strapi parser, so KISS should be rule #1.

#### One more thing about advanced parsing:
Every single change should be possible with something as simple as single line of bash or SQL query.
Just keep in mind: possible, not made! Don't use bash, it's awful and unmanageable really quick.

### Low on effort, low on dopamine
My main blocker in this project is my depression, and overall lacking of. That's why I made a rule of
