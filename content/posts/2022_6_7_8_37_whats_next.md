# It's published and accessible
### What's next?
So, basically I wrote this simple blog, so I can add content and work on it simultaneously, but it is
really simple and has a few flaws that should be addressed soon:

- there is no paging
- there are no links for single post
- there are no tests
- markdown limitations can be... limiting
- no comments? they could be fun!

### How I'm going to address this?
Well, to be honest, I have no better idea to just continue with writing until something bad happens.
Then I will fix!
