# We're starting!
### So, here it is. 
I planned begetting my personal space for some time now, but well, procrastination.

### So, what it is?
It's a blog with posts completely stored in git repository and rendered from markdown. 

It's eco! 

I hope that in this easy way of edition and easy integration I will be able to maintain this
for at least some time, probably learning a thing or two and improving by writing skill.

If you see this at the very beginning of this page, it means that it was not a good approach,
or I was much less motivated than I though.
